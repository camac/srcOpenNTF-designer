===================

Changes to the com.ibm.xsp.extlib.designer plugin to allow contributions to the ThemeLookup

Dear IBM XPages Team, can you please have a look if you could include functionality similar to this in the next release of the Extlib?

The changes are based on the release on OpenNTF 901v00_07.20140619-1400
